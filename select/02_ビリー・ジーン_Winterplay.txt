She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

'cause we danced on the floor in the round

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round,
She said I am the one,
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
The smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
